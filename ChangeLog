	* Rakefile, lib/require_relative.rb, test/test-rr.rb: 
	require_relative: Add RequireRelative::abs_file which is like
	__FILE__ but gives the absolute location.  Rakefile: Had broken
	tests because rake's default mechanism appears to be broken here and
	I don't know why.  test-rr.rb: Reinstate more stringent testing -
	chdir before require_relative
