h2. Ruby 1.9's relative_relative for Rubinus 1.0.1

Here we add in Module RequireRelative method: *require_relative*, and *abs_file*. Example:

bc.  require_relative './lib/foo' 

But why *abs_file*?. Well, recall that *__FILE__* does not give an absolute path. So if you have chdir'd before useing *__FILE__*, you might not be able to retrieve the full path.
